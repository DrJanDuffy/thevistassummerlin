# Communities

This folder contains individual pages for each subcommunity in The Vistas Summerlin.

- Each file (e.g., `Altessa.tsx`, `Ashton-Park.tsx`) represents a subcommunity and uses a standardized hero image pattern.
- All pages are accessible via `/communities/{subcommunity}` routes.
- Hero images are stored in `public/subcommunities/` and referenced in each page.

## Adding/Updating Pages
- To add a new subcommunity, create a new file following the naming convention and use the standard template.
- To update a hero image, place the new image in `public/subcommunities/` and update the `src` in the page component.

## Contribution
- Keep this folder in sync with the authoritative list of subcommunities.
- Remove legacy or unused files as needed.
