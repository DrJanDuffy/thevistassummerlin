# Subcommunity Images

This folder contains hero images for each subcommunity in The Vistas Summerlin.

- Name each image after the subcommunity (e.g., `altessa.jpg`, `ashton-park.jpg`).
- Reference these images in the corresponding subcommunity page (e.g., `/subcommunities/altessa.jpg`).
- If a subcommunity does not have a custom image, the default `/hero.jpg` will be used.

## Usage
- Place new images here to update the hero image for a subcommunity.
- Keep image file sizes optimized for web performance.
