# Status: pending

# Description: Optimize property search with intelligent features and visual results
# Details:
Implement intelligent search bars with autocomplete and address suggestions. Hide advanced filters under progressive disclosure to focus on core criteria (price, location, property type).

Test search functionality across different devices and browsers, verify autocomplete accuracy, and validate schema markup.
